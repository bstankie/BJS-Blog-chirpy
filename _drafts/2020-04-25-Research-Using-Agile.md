# TL;DR

* Agile Scrum is designed for incremental improvements when you know what the goal is.
* Doing research in an Agile Scrum framework can be a challenge when you don't know how to get from 'here to there'.
* Two tools for doing research in an Agile Scrum framework:
    1. **Timebox**: Provide the researcher a period of time to investigate or research a solution. You can give the story a set of points given the time box. 
        * The DoD typically is "Investigate X for Y days". 
    2. **Question**: Focus on answering a specific question such as "Can reinforcement learning be used to identify the type of user when we only have 100 users?"

# Research in Agile

The agile process is very good when you have a good idea of how to get from 'here to there'. It focuses on small incremental steps that allow you to learn and adapt your product given the most recent information that you have. Interestingly enough, this is how the scientific process also works. Use the most recent research available, figure out the next question to ask, answer that question and add it to the body of human knowledge.

## Differences between Engineering and Research

Although both Agile and Research have the same fundamental processes (incremental learning and adaptation) it can be difficult to do research in an agile
