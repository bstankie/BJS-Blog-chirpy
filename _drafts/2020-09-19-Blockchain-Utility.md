# tldr; 

Due to the hyper-valuation of Bitcoin in 2017, most of the interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency has focused on speculation. However, without some value, these cryptocurrencies/blockchains will collapse on themselves. The initial *value* of bitcoin was the fact that it was 'decentralized' and 'immutable'. No single entity was in control of the transactions but instead transactions were proven by a collection of loosely coupled computer systems and since it was decentralized, transactions were immutable (unchangeable/'unhackable'). All (as far as I know) blockchain/cryptocurrencies have these properties so that utility/value is table stakes. As of 2020 there are four dimensions that differentiate the multitude of blockchain technologies:

2. Transaction speed
3. Transaction Privacy
4. Transaction 'Friction'
3. Transaction Resources
4. Non-Exchange Utility
5. Ubiquity

# Overview

Currencies is an interesting concept in that they only have value in as much as two people agree that the value of this currency. Take a moment and think about your 'paycheck' in the current age. Most people have their paycheck directly deposited into their bank account and then electronically transfer those funds to other banks to make mortgage payments, pay for groceries, etc. There is an assumption that those values in my bank account will be able to be traded for other goods and services. Conventional currency allows for low-friction transactions.

## Transaction Speed

One of the challenges of early cryptocurrency as a currency for the masses was the amount of time that it took to prove a transaction. Conventional currency, either through physical or credit card exchanges can be near immediate. By contrast, early cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) typically takes multiple minutes. Unfortunately, this does not currently scale to today's purchasing workflow (see [Blockchain Scalability Problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44)). To this end, many cryptocurrencies have adopted different methods for proving a transaction to reduce this latency.

## Transaction Privacy

One of the claims is that blockchain is anonymous. However, this is not entirely true. All of the blocks are public on the Bitcoin chain. They are anonymous in-as-much as I do not know who owns which wallet. However, if you and I exchange Bitcoin cryptocurrency and I provide you with my wallet's public address, you can see how much I have in that wallet (see 'blockchain explorers' like [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/)). There are ways to work around this, but some cryptocurrencies have made privacy their 'value-add' proposition.

## Transaction 'Friction'

'Transaction Friction' refers to how difficult is it to exchange the funds. Some cryptocurrencies are very cumbersome (e.g., requiring the receiver to have a wallet address, getting and exchanging the address) while others have worked to remove a lot of the friction through intuitive addresses and methods.

## Transaction Resources

One of the criticisms of blockchain and Bitcoin specifically is the amount of energy that it takes to run the decentralized system. Thousands of computers from around the world are 'mining' and all of them require electricity to run. For an overview of this issue see [Bitcoin Energy Consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) article. Some cryptocurrencies have made their value-add proposition being that they do not require as many resources to run their blockchain.

## Non-Exchange Utility

After the concept of blockchain and cryptocurrency, the most innovative move of the blockchain movement was the concept of *[decentralized applications](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp)* ('dApps') iintroduced by the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) platform. The innovation was to store simple programs and data on the blockchain that would decentralize these applications. Out of this came many applications including 'smart contracts'. This created a utility for a cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) that went beyond just reducing friction in an exchange--you could use the currency exchange as an application platform. 

## Ubiquity

One of the values of conventional currency (e.g., US dollars) is it's ubiquity. Every vender in the US will accept and use it. With the proliferation of cryptocurrencies some currencies are more ubiquitous than others while none have reached the level of US dollars. When thinking of cyrptocurrency ubiquity I make an analogy to the ubiquity of platforms for exchanging US dollars. [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) is highly ubiquitous with other methods such as [Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/), [Venmo](https://venmo.com/), [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/about/) less ubiquitous. When I want to exchange funds with another individual we have to have a common platform for that exchange to happen. There is value in a platform being ubiquitous.

# Conventional Currency

For a moment let us look at conventional currency (e.g., US dollars). 

**Speed**: The transaction *speed* can range from immediate (exchange physical currency) to days (electronic transfer of funds ETF).

**Privacy**: Anonymous (physical exchange) to semi-private (credit card or ETF).

**Transaction Friction**: Low given the ubiquity of electronic transfers through ETF, credit cards, [Paypal](https://paypal.com) or other fund transfer mechanisms. However, physical exchange can be quite high given that I have to physically exchange the currency which requires shipping or meeting.

**Transaction Resources**: Low to none.

**Non-Exchange Utility**: Conventional currency has no utility beyond reducing the friction for transactions.

**Ubiquity**: Conventional currency is highly ubiquitous.
