# Overview

This was the first day 'learning' about AWS and robotics. Below you will find the set of videos that I worked through and my notes from those videos. These notes are not intended to necessarily be consumed by others, but I thought that they might be useful for someone that is looking for good tutorial videos. I will continue to document my journey and in a month, provide an overall summary and recommendations for a learning path.

I still have not found a good collection of tutorials that walks you from 'getting started' in AWS to 'fleet management'. Might be out there but I just haven't found it yet. My hope is that by going through these I might be able to create a set of these types of tutorial. This is the start.

## Videos
* [Using AWS RoboMaker Simulation for Real World Applications](#RealWorldApps)
    * **REVIEW**: Not a great video. Very high-level with no real **meat** in the video. Would only recommend if you don't know anything about RoboMaker, AWS or programming. Most of the videos start with a high-level review of the AWS technology so you will get this overview over time.
* [Build Your First Cloud-Connected Robot](#BuildCloudRobot)
    * **REVIEW**: Fun video. On the right track. Cool things that have been made, but there was not a lot of 'digging in'. They promised digging in, but never really did. Looked for the follow-up videos but I could not find them (see [Todo Items](#todo)) 
* [Getting Started with Robots & AWS RoboMaker](#GettingStartedRoboMaker)
    * **REVIEW**: Great starter video for where I am at. I know how to program. Know a bit about AWS full-stack development. Went through an example with 'Paired Programming' approach. Things learned: How to leverage Cloud9, writing python code to define a ROS node, how to bundle a robot package and a simulation package (well sort of, see [Todo Items](#todo)), import bundles into S3 for use with RoboMaker and how to configure those bundles.

## Items learned on this Day
1. AWS Cloud9 has integrated RoboMaker dev tools to make developing, testing and deploying easier.
2. How to build and integrate a ROS defined robot into RoboMaker.
    * Build robot and simulation ros files.
    * ROS programming is python
    * See Video notes for [Getting Started with Robots & AWS RoboMaker](#<a name="GettingStartedRoboMaker"></a>) below.
3. Learned a little about servos
    * Brief reference in the [Build Your First Cloud-Connected Robot](https://youtu.be/Paw7fkGUg18) video. See notes in [Build Your First Cloud-Connected Robot](#BuildCloudRobot) video.

## <a name="todo"></a>ToDo Items

1. Need to learn more about how to do two-way interactions with the Dynamixel servos.
2. Learn how to bundle ROS *robot* and *simulation* packages.
3. Find if there are more videos for the [Build Cloud-Connected Robots](#BuildCloudRobot)

# Videos

## <a name="RealWorldApps"></a>[Using AWS RoboMaker Simulation for Real World Applications](https://youtu.be/eQYUAMFvpLg)
* [Video Link](https://youtu.be/eQYUAMFvpLg)
* Overview video with not a lot of depth. 
* Just walks through the services with statements of 'You can do this...' without showing you how to do anything.
* Speed video up to at least 1.5. Speaker, speaks very slowly.
* Learned: Cloud9 has ROS tooling

## <a name="BuildCloudRobot"></a> [Build Your First Cloud-Connected Robot](https://youtu.be/Paw7fkGUg18)
* [Video Link](https://youtu.be/Paw7fkGUg18)
* A build video. 
* Show-and-tell with multiple robots.
* No 'getting your hands dirty'
* Cool application using [Leap Motion Tracker](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/) and robots.
* Learned about the benefits of [Dynamixel](http://www.robotis.us/dynamixel/) servos.
    * Small on-board computers that not only receive, but also sends information about the status of the serve (**NOTE**: Need to learn more about how to do two-way interactions with the Dynamixel servos.)
* Promised to show in future episodes but unable to find those episodes.

## <a name="GettingStartedRoboMaker"></a>[Getting Started with Robots & AWS RoboMaker](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8)
* [Video Link](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8)
* Starting to get hands dirty.
* Cloned a 'Hello world' repository.
* Under `src` folder there is a `package.xml`
    * All of the information on the packages that need to be installed to get your robot to run.
* `CMakeLists.txt`: Makefile. Describes how the applications are built. What files are needed, etc.
* ROS programming is based on noeds.
* Point in video where they begin [RosPy Programming](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8?t=532) of the robot node.
* Nodes are small micro-functions that can be assigned to parts of the robot (e.g., `rotate.py`)
### Video Point. [Build Your Robot: launch file](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8?t=1380) (`rotate.launch`)
### Video Point. [Build Your Robot: build the robot packages](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8).
```bash
cd robot_ws
colcon build #Builds all of the code
source install/local_setup.sh # Run in Cloud9 with messages
# roslaunch <nameOfPackage> <NameofFileToLaunch>: 
# to launch the program in the Cloud9 environment
roslaunch hello_world_robot rotate.lauch  
```
### Video Point. [Build Your Robot: Start integrating RoboMaker](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8?t=2038)
* You need to bundle the packages but they don't describe how to do that. Pre-baked because it takes a few minutes to get done.
    * **NOTE**: Learn how to bundle the packages.
```bash
cd robot_ws
# File called output.tar
# Copy the bundle file to an S3 bucket
# aws s3 cp bundle/ouput.tar s3://<bucketName>/<fileName.tar>
aws s3 cp bundle/ouput.tar s3://aws-tutorial/robot_ws.tar
```
### Setup RoboMaker Robot Definition.

### Setup RoboMaker Simulation Environment.
* **NOTE**: They do not describe how to make the `simulation_ws.tar` file. Not sure if it is built with the `colcon build` command or another command.

### Video Point. [Build Your Robot: Simulation Job](https://youtu.be/4R4_GCiayD8?t=2430).
* Pre-baked so don't go into the details of how to connect the Robot and environment into the simulation job.
