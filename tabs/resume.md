## OBJECTIVE
Obtain a technical development position at a forward-looking, growth minded company that can leverage my 20+ years of experience in research and development to create new business opportunities. 

## SKILLS
* **Programming Languages**: Python (proficient), Matlab (capable), JavaScript (capable)
* **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Markov Modeling, Natural Language Processing
* **Cloud Development**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* **Publications**: 20+ Research papers, 20+ Patents
* **Agile**: Eight years experience using agile. Product Owner, Scrum Master trained through [Scrum Inc.](https://www.scruminc.com/)

**Program Champion**: I identify technical and business opportunities that are on the horizon and provide technical leadership and collaborate with  business leaders to create a clear technical vision supported by business opportunities. I am able to communicate the vision to senior leadership (e.g., CTO, CEO, SVPs). I excel in developing clear, ambitious technical visions that technical teams can execute on while business leaders can understand so they can build new business growth. 

**Technical Leadership**: In building a technical vision, I seek to understand the critical basic, and applied research in the relevant area (usually, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, data science). In this process I will build the intellectual property roadmap that includes evaluating existing intellectual property along with identifying potential opportunities. My expertise has been sought for technical evaluations of mergers and acquisitions multiple  times in 3M.

**Organization Creation**: Through program championing, I have identified opportunities for 3M in new technical areas and made the case that 3M should invest in building these capabilities. By starting with small transformations within the company to serve as ‘proof points’, these efforts ultimately have led to the creation of multiple new organizations within 3M (AI Lab, Data Science Lab, Materials Informatics Team). 

## EXPERIENCE

### 3M Corporate Research Labs, St. Paul, MN— Principal Data Scientist
*Jul 2017 – Present*

## PROJECTS

**Materials Informatics** — Identified the opportunity to accelerate 3M material science research by developing a capability in Materials Informatics. Led the first proof-of-concept project to demonstrate the value in storing and connecting 3M research formulations with their characterization data. Demonstrated the ability to apply machine learning techniques to predict material performance from small data sets. Developed methods for streamlining the scale-up process from lab to manufacturing by bringing automation into the 3M labs. My experience applying AI in an advanced manufacturing context has taught me how to effectively deliver technology in collaboration with experts in disparate fields (materials science, ai, software engineering, automation) across a wide range of technical and non-technical applications.

**[Visual Attention Service](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/visual-attention-software-us/)** — Product owner for the Visual Attention Service is an on-line application that simulates the neurological properties of the human visual system to predict what people will notice in a scene in the first 3-5 seconds. Scoped and led the technical development. Developed the IP strategy and contributed to the business model. My experience of building 3M’s first commercial AI system taught me the value of educating senior leadership and identifying existing talent with untapped potential.

**[Performance Matrix](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Performance-Matrix-Platform/?N=5002385+3290718635&rt=rud)** — Served as a product owner for a  joint 3M-Google technical team to develop a proof of concept and initial production system. Served to ensure that the teams from 3M and Google-Verily were able to move as quickly as possible by identifying potential impediments and quickly communicating to 3M senior management and/or my Google-Verily peers the issue, potential solutions and drove the process until the issue was resolved. My experience with working on a collaborative project with two large corporations in diverse markets with strong, but different cultures taught me how to effectively listen and  communicate across these challenging lines.
